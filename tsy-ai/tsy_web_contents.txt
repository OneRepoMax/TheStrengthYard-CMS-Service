#####  [Geoff Fazan](https://www.thestrengthyard.com/geoff-fazan/)

I didn't know quite what to expect when I first came to The Strength Yard, as
it is hard to judge a book by the cover. Terence explained The Strength Yard
purpose well and the sort of strength training we would be doing and why.
After a couple of sessions getting to know one another, going to The Strength
Yard felt very natural.... **Read More**

#####  [Scott](https://www.thestrengthyard.com/scott/)

I came to The Strength Yard looking to be taught the correct way to lift
weights in order to avoid injury. I met Ian, who taught to me the proper form
and technique to lifting weights. I have made progression through learning the
movements at a pace I was comfortable with.... **Read More**

#####  [Max Koh](https://www.thestrengthyard.com/max-koh/)

I joined because i just turned 30 and have been lifting on my own consistently
for the last 8 years. Felt that my workouts were getting stale, and i also
wanted someone to ensure I was lifting with proper form, for fear of injuries
as I am no longer in my 20s.... **Read More**

#####  [Elisabeth Kelly](https://www.thestrengthyard.com/elisabeth-kelly/)

Before I started Strength Training at The Strength Yard, I would wonder, would
a young male trainer understand the needs, health issues (hormonal) and goals
of a woman almost twice his age? However Terence is a patient and
understanding trainer.... **Read More**

I feel relaxed and not super pressurizing when Terence was coaching me.
Initially I had the impression that going to the gym or doing weightlifting
was going be super intense or difficult but turns out that wasn't the case....

#####  [EVA LEUNG](https://www.thestrengthyard.com/eva-leung/)

I’ve tried weight watchers, noom, vegan, whole30, and a smattering of other
diets, so I was a bit skeptical if it was another diet where I have to starve
myself and eat yucky food. I also really didn’t want to bulk up and look like
a female version of Arnold Swazenager.... **Read More**

As a runner, I have always been trying to strengthen my gluteus to improve my
running and to prevent injury. Using 3kg of dumbbell to do squat has proven
not as effective. I randomly ran into The Strength Yard, spoke to Terence and
arranged a trial session with him.... **Read More**

At first, I had reservations about signing up because I wasn't sure if it's
going to work or not (whether I will be losing weight or just losing money). I
was also apprehensive that I'll be stuck with a haughty, macho Johnny-Bravo
type of trainer. However, Terence is very professional, accommodating and
humble.... **Read More**

## TESTIMONIAL

> **ZANE**

“The massage was up to my expectations, it addressed my tightness in various
muscles and after the session I felt better with less knee pain as well.”
[@zane_ljh](https://www.instagram.com/zane_ljh/)

When a muscle is tight it can irritate nerve receptors within the muscle. This
in turn can lead to feelings of muscular pain and discomfort.  
As for Zane’s case, he has been feeling some discomfort around the patella
area which could be due to the increased training volume from squatting.
Therefore, reducing muscular tension can lead to a reduction in nerve
irritation and a reduction in muscular pain and discomfort.

## Strength Training And Aging

Leading a sedentary lifestyle leads to muscle atrophy. It is the medical term
that describes the process of your muscles wasting away. When your muscles
aren’t exercised to their full capacity, they begin to break down.

When your body begins to lose muscle, your metabolism slows and you begin to
gain weight. Increased body fat eats away at testosterone, and it can be a
vicious cycle. Low testosterone causes depression, lethargy, and fatigue that
can keep you from exercising to lose fat and build muscle.

## The Job Of A Personal Trainer

Many often wonder if the cost of having a Personal Trainer is worth it.

The short answer is perhaps. If you have the intrinsic motivation, you can
join a gym and plan your own program independently by referring to the
numerous resources available online, not a problem at all.

## Strength Training And Your Immunity

Upper respiratory tract infections (The common cold, sinusitis etc.) are the
most common illness that people get. Most are due to an infection with a virus
and the average adult has two to four URTIs each year.

We are constantly exposed to the viruses that cause these infections but some
people seem more susceptible to catching URTIs than others and our immune
system plays an important part that protect us from an army of pathogenic
microbes that bombard the body.

## Setting Your New Year’s Fitness Resolution

After a holiday season of being merry, many of us start setting fitness
resolutions for the New year only to see them fall by the wayside.

It Is a pretty depressing statistic. In fact, survey shows that only 20% of
people actually achieve their goals and more than 70% of people give up within
the first 2 months.

## Introduction To Olympic Weightlifting

weightlifting’ is one of the oldest forms of weight training. The moves are
incredibly technical and they take require considerable strength to complete.

## When You Hit A Plateau In Training And How To Deal With It

We know you take your training seriously. From our serious competitive
athletes to our casual class members you are always looking to be the
strongest version of yourselves.

There is only so much we can progressively overload till we hit a wall in
training. Some lucky ones have a higher threshold than others but we’ll all
eventually find our progress starting to get slower or for even some, remain
stagnant for a period of time.

## Stay Fit While Traveling

Hey everybody, holiday season is upon us and in fact, we have just treated
ourselves to a weekend road trip to Malaysia, tasting the local cuisine and
sampling every type of street food.

While I know many of you will start stressing out over how to remain fit while
on the road, understand that your hard work will not be gone to waste.

I have never pictured myself lifting a barbell and the thought was
intimidating. I was unsure if I will be learn the basics and make any
meaningful progress. Coach Phina made an effort to understand where I stood in

training, focussing on getting the foundation right.... **Read More**

#####  [Geoff Fazan](https://www.thestrengthyard.com/geoff-fazan/)

I didn't know quite what to expect when I first came to The Strength Yard, as
it is hard to judge a book by the cover. Terence explained The Strength Yard
purpose well and the sort of strength training we would be doing and why.
After a couple of sessions getting to know one another, going to The Strength
Yard felt very natural.... **Read More**

I came to The Strength Yard looking to be taught the correct way to lift

I joined because i just turned 30 and have been lifting on my own consistently

wanted someone to ensure I was lifting with proper form, for fear of injuries

I’ve tried weight watchers, noom, vegan, whole30, and a smattering of other

As a runner, I have always been trying to strengthen my gluteus to improve my

At first, I had reservations about signing up because I wasn't sure if it's
going to work or not (whether I will be losing weight or just losing money). I
was also apprehensive that I'll be stuck with a haughty, macho Johnny-Bravo
type of trainer. However, Terence is very professional, accommodating and

## TESTIMONIAL

> **ZANE**

“The massage was up to my expectations, it addressed my tightness in various
muscles and after the session I felt better with less knee pain as well.”
[@zane_ljh](https://www.instagram.com/zane_ljh/)

When a muscle is tight it can irritate nerve receptors within the muscle. This
in turn can lead to feelings of muscular pain and discomfort.  
As for Zane’s case, he has been feeling some discomfort around the patella
area which could be due to the increased training volume from squatting.
Therefore, reducing muscular tension can lead to a reduction in nerve
irritation and a reduction in muscular pain and discomfort.

![Top Weight Lifting Gyms in Singapore](https://mediaonemarketing.com.sg/wp-
content/uploads/2021/03/Top-Weight-Lifting-Gyms-in-Singapore.jpg)

## **What is weight lifting?**

Weight lifting is a type of strength training exercise that uses weights as
part of the exercise regime. By using free weights such as barbells or
dumbbells and weight machines, these exercises activate and train certain
muscles in the body, allowing you to become stronger.

## **What are the benefits associated with weight lifting?**

Weight lifting goes beyond merely adding strength to your body. It is a great
total body workout that helps to keep you in shape and burns away those excess
body fat.

Here are some of the common health benefits associated with weight lifting:

### **Burns more body fat than cardio**

If you absolutely dread running, then weight lifting is a perfect alternative
to your exercise regime! In fact, lifting weights help to burn more body fat
as compared to cardio exercises.

Weight lifting helps to increase your lean body mass and build more muscles.
As you build and strengthen your muscles, this keeps your body burning fat
throughout the entire day.

### **Lose belly fat**

Does it seem like no amount of exercise can help to get rid of that muffin
top? Perhaps you have been doing the wrong type of exercises all along. Weight
lifting is said to significantly help reduce belly fat. As you lift the
weights to strengthen your muscles, you invariantly end up using your core
muscles during the weight lifting process. This gives you a total abdominal
workout without you having to try too hard!

### **Strengthen your bones**

Lifting weights does not only strengthen your muscles, it trains and
strengthens your bones as well. As you perform a bicep curl for instance, the
muscles will tug at your arm’s bones, triggering the cells in your bones to
create new bone cells.

### **Gives your heart’s health a boost**

Cardiovascular exercises are not the only type of exercise that targets your
heart health. In fact, weight lifting can also give your heart’s health a
boost! As you build more muscle and strength, this fuels your body with energy
to burn excess fat and encourage better blood flow. All of these lead to a
better and stronger heart!

### **Builds your confidence**

Besides helping you build strength, weight lifting also helps to tone your
overall body. When you are in shape, chances are that you will feel good as
well. This helps to boost your self-esteem and builds your confidence levels!

## **How much weight lifting is enough?**

Some of us may associate weight lifting to people with super defined muscles
and veins that appear to pop up at almost every part of the body.

Truth is, it all lies in your weight lifting technique. In fact, you do not
have to be in the gym for a 2 hour session to see visible results! Ideally,
two to three sessions of 20 or 30 minutes of weight lifting exercise over the
entire week can help to significantly improve your strength in no time.

## **How much weight should I lift?**

The amount of weight that you should be using depends on the number of
repetitions that you intend to do. For instance, if you are planning to do
just 6 repetitions, you probably should use a heavier dumbbell compared to if
you were intending to do 12 repetitions.

As a safety precaution, avoid using too heavy weights such that it causes you
pain when you lift the weights. As your body gets used to the weight lifting,
you may then gradually increase the weights used.

## **What are some of the safety tips when doing weight lifting exercises?**

Like any exercise, weight lifting comes with its set of inherent risks. Here
are some tips to ensure safer and effective weight lifting workouts.

### **Always warm up and cool down**

If you are short on time and tempted to go straight to the bench press from
the changing rooms, think twice! While you may be able to still lift those
weights, your muscles may allow you to lift more if they were warmed up.
Warming up helps to stretch and relax those tight muscles, allowing you to
reap the maximum benefits from your weight lifting workout.

Similarly, ensure that you cool down after each workout to allow your muscles
to rest and recover.

### **Learn the proper weight lifting technique**

If you are completely new to weight lifting, it is best to seek professional
help and advice least you injure yourself. Engaging a gym instructor allows
you to learn the proper method of lifting weights based on the target muscle
group.

### **Do not rely on momentum to do the work**

It may be easier to lift your weights up and down quickly. For example, some
people carry the dumbbells up slowly only to let it crash down to the floor.
Doing that does not train the right muscle groups. In fact, it is akin to just
tossing a ball up and down.

To prevent that from happening, use the 2-2-2 method. Take 2 seconds to lift
the weights, pause at the top for 2 seconds before taking another 2 seconds to
return the weight to its starting position.

### **Always breathe when lifting**

Most people tend to forget to breathe when lifting the weights. It is
important to ensure that you are consistently breathing when you lift as you
will need a lot of oxygen to support the lifting action.

For most exercises, it is recommended to exhale when you lift and inhale as
you release. Simply put, always exhale during exertion.

### **Vary your weight lifting routine**

To ensure that you see visible results during the course of your weight
lifting exercise regime, try to mix up your routine. This helps to build
defined muscles throughout your body instead of just a certain area.

For example, you may allocate certain days to the week to focus on building
strength in your arms. The remaining days can be dedicated to training your
legs.

Similarly, vary the weights and number of repetitions. As you gradually build
up your strength, you may start to increase the weights and repetitions while
reducing the rest time in between each set.

# 8 strength & conditioning gyms you should try in Singapore

  * [ Cheryl Tay  ](https://cheryltay.sg/author/cheryl-tay/)
  * [ July 3, 2015  ](https://cheryltay.sg/2015/07/03/)

**Train your body as the machine, not with machines  
**_Keep your training raw and rough with these gyms_

You don’t need fanciful machines to train. Sometimes I get overwhelmed by the
influx of advanced machines in globo gyms especially. For example, it’s not
just TV that you can watch while running on the treadmill. Now you can also
surf the internet and book that holiday you didn’t have time to do in the
office. I wouldn’t be able to run very fast if I’m doing that though.

Dumbbells, kettlebells, barbells, medicine balls and the all-important squat
rack are more than sufficient. No need for the frills and just get back to
basics. Here are **8 strength and conditioning gyms in Singapore** where you
train your body as the machine and not with machines. You won’t find a
treadmill in these places.

Get ready to work out raw and rough:

## **1) Solitude of Strength**

National weightlifting record holder Lewis Chua started [Solitude of
Strength](http://www.solitudeofstrength.com) (SoS) in September 2013. His
2,400 square-feet space has all the equipment every strength athlete can dream
of. SoS is also home of [CrossFit Statera](http://www.crossfitstatera.com),
which is helmed by Head Coach John Cheah, one of Singapore’s top CrossFit
athletes.

If you prefer to plan your own workout, you can pay the walk-in rates of $12
for adults and $8 for students (or get a monthly membership) and do your own
thing. Open gym hours are between 9am to 9pm. Weightlifting classes are held
every Tuesday night and gymnastics classes are held every Thursday night.
CrossFit classes run daily. Personal training sessions are also available.

[![Strength of Solitude \(600x136\)](https://cheryltay.sg/wp-
content/uploads/2014/07/Strength-of-
Solitude-600x136.jpg)](https://cheryltay.sg/wp-
content/uploads/2014/07/Strength-of-Solitude-600x136.jpg)

_Solitude of Strength is located at Blk 37 Lor 23 Geylang. More
at[www.facebook.com/SolitudeOfStrength](http://www.facebook.com/SolitudeOfStrength)._

## **2) UFit**

UFit, Urban Fitness it means, is this 5,000-square-feet facility in the CBD
area which offers personal training, nutrition guidance, physiotherapy, sports
massage and MMA. They are also known for their outdoor group training such as
the UFIT Bootcamp, RunFIT and UFIT Core. No open gym to the public but you can
sign up for a free trial. They also have a huge group of trainers, about 22
the last I checked.

[![2011-10-25-07-55-20](https://cheryltay.sg/wp-
content/uploads/2015/07/2011-10-25-07-55-20-1024x768.jpg)](https://cheryltay.sg/wp-
content/uploads/2015/07/2011-10-25-07-55-20.jpg)

_UFit is located at 87 Amoy Street. More at
[www.ufit.com.sg](http://www.ufit.com.sg)._

## **3) The Pit**

The Pit has been around since 2011 and is known for being a hardcore gym. It
moved to Orchard last September. You get a sense of ‘beast mode’ when you are
there and members are often referred to as ‘PITbulls’. This is where Chew Feng
Yi trains – yes the one who broke all three events at the Global Powerlifting
Alliance on 13 March 2015. Competing in the Under 48kg category, she lifted
150kg, 120kg and 62.5kg in the deadlift, squat and bench press events
respectively.

There is a lot of emphasis on barbell work and the four basic lifts, as
managing director Irving Henson believes in strength before conditioning. You
can sign up for personal training or attend classes like Metcon, TacFit and
Muay Thai. They also have specific sports training for golfers and
triathletes. Open gym is for members only.

_The Pit is located at 123 Devonshire Road. More
at[www.pitpersonaltrainer.com.sg](http://www.pitpersonaltrainer.com.sg/)._

## **4) Ritual**

[Ritual](http://www.ritualgym.com) is a boutique gym with a clever HIIT (high
intensity interval training) concept that caters best to working
professionals. Limited to 10 people a class, the same 20-minute workout is run
every half hour so you can book any session that suits your schedule. The
remaining time is for you to shower and grab a protein shake before you get
back to work. Working attire is provided and you train barefoot.

_Ritual is located at 11 North Canal Rd. More
at[www.ritualgym.com](http://www.ritualgym.com)._

## **5) Grit – Training for Warriors**

Opened in May 2014 down the same road as Ritual, [Grit
](https://cheryltay.sg/grit-training-for-warriors-singapore/ "Grit – Training
for Warriors")is the first and only affiliate of the Training for Warriors
(TFW) system in Singapore. TFW is a physical and mental training programme
created for fighters more than 10 years ago, but you do not have to be a
fighter to take this on. It involves speed, strength and endurance training,
as well as flexibility work. Classes offered include Strength, Power (next
level after Strength), Hurricane Day (metcon) and Active Recovery, limited to
no more than five participants per session.

_Grit is located at 39D North Canal Road. More
at[www.tfwsingapore.com](http://www.tfwsingapore.com/)._

## 6) The Strength Yard

As you can tell from its name, The Strength Yard is the place where you can
literally build strength. It is also known as the Barbell Club. This is a pure
open strength and conditioning gym with no classes. You can walk in and work
out by yourself at $8 for a day pass or $65 for a month, every day of the
week. Equipment includes squat racks, barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells,
prowler and tyres. It’s not a full functional strength and conditioning gym,
without things like rings and rowers, but it’s enough for most people.

[![1961715_1537582399786896_8857588063685282716_o](https://cheryltay.sg/wp-

_The Strength Yard is located at 58 Joo Chiat Place. More
at[www.thestrengthyard.com](http://www.thestrengthyard.com/)._

## 7) Level

Level is a human movement-focused gym where you’ll find pull-up bars,
barbells, rings, ropes, kettlebells and space for squatting, running, jumping,
climbing, lifting and throwing. They offer personal training, partner training
(so you don’t have to train alone) and classes such as ColeMine (HIIT), Friday
Under The Bar (barbell strength work) and Weekend Warrior (boot camp). You can
sign up for a trial too.

_Level is located at 137 Telok Ayer Street #01-03. More
at[www.level.com.sg](http://level.com.sg/)._

## 8) Sweatshop

I love this name. I feel like I’ve already worked out before going there, LOL!
Focused on circular strength training, they believe your body was meant to
squat, crawl, climb, plank, pull, push, press, rotate, pivot and become the
ultimate dancing machine. Uh huh, dance. No barbells or weight plates, but
there are gym rings, pull-up bars, ropes, clubbells, kettlebells, medicine
balls, punching bags/gloves/pads. You can walk in to use their facilities for
S$30 a month or S$180 for unlimited. They have boot camp, Muay Thai, TacFit or
personal training.

# Top Gyms In Singapore

![Top Gyms In Singapore](https://mediaonemarketing.com.sg/wp-
content/uploads/2020/04/Top-Gyms-In-Singapore.jpg)

The fitness industry in Singapore is booming.

In 2020, the industry generated about $24 million in revenue, with a projected
annual growth of 6%. That means, by 2024, the industry will be generating
about $30 million in revenue.

## **So, What’s a GYM?**

GYM = Gymnasium

It’s a building, club, or large room, usually filled with workout equipment,
where people go to do physical exercise and stay fit. They’re common in
learning facilities, as well as fitness centres and athletic centres.

Some people also use the term gym to refer to a fitness centre, an enclosed
area, or room for indoor recreation. The main difference is that a gym doesn’t
necessarily have to be set indoors.

## **Why is Gym Class Important?**

Here are seven awesome reasons you need to start going to the gym:

### **It’s Healthy**

No need to belabour the obvious – hitting the gym is the first step to a
healthy lifestyle. The correlation that exists between exercising and health
is pretty simple and straightforward. Just working out is enough to make you
happier, lose weight, increase your energy levels, reduce chronic illnesses,
and so forth.

### **Gain Confidence**

Hitting the gym will improve your overall look. You’ll lose weight, get
buffed, tone down, and generally appear healthy. Your skin will also improve.
In other words, hitting the gym will work miracles on your body, the result of
which you’ll start feeling so much better about yourself.

### **Relieve Stress**

The gym can be a great stress reliever. When working out, you forget about all
your woes and focus on improving yourself. The body also responds by releasing
endorphins, which leave you with a euphoric feeling. The end result would be
you feeling better mentally.

### **Coordination and Flexibility**

Ever felt rigid or numb when trying to engage in certain activities? You don’t
need to be reminded that you should at least sign up with a gym class near.
The various activities you do in the gym will, in the end, help you develop
better coordination when engaging in other activities, such as playing
basketball, swinging a bar, and aiming an arrow.

### **Socialisation**

This is one aspect of the gym that many people overlook. You just never know
who you’ll meet in your gym classes. You’ll make friends, meet clients, and
grow your network. This is especially true if you’re a freelancer who spends
the bulk of your time alone.

| “Joined Genesis gym 10weeks after giving birth. With the guidance and
motivation from the coaches, consistency in attending the workout sessions and
discipline to stick better food choices, I lost 5% body fat in 5weeks! There’s
a wealth of knowledge in Genesis gym and I would highly recommend anyone to
join. All you need to do is to get yourself to gym! Once you’re there, you’re
a step closer to achieving your goals and dreams ;)” – Hazel.H  
  
**Review 2**

| “I’ve been training at Genesis Gym for closed to 2 years now. The many few
reasons why I chose to stick to Genesis was because all of their trainers are
knowledgeable and are able to correct your form and posture immediately. The
gym itself provides clean and well maintained equipments, and not to mention
the tailored program creates results. If you’re determined to be fitter and
stronger, this is the gym to be at! I’ve seen myself grown a lot stronger over
the course of 2 years, and I’m continuing to train her to be even better and
stronger.” – Trisha.K  
  
**Review 3**

| “I’ve trained with Genesis for over 5 years now. All the trainers are
personable and knowledgeable. They are eager to help and know when to give you
space. I appreciate this style of training, which emphasizes proper form in
slow, methodical, and functional movements. It is for this reason I will
continue to train at Genesis.” – Peggy.M

so I got in touch with this place. Signing up was easy, just a visit during
office hours and I received a 24/7 key. The gym is medium-sized but packed
with everything you need – machines and free weights up 120lb + . Clean, and
the air con works. I was there daily from 5:30-7:00 and it was quiet.

“I am always in Singapore for a short business trip. I love their cardio
machines. Third time in this gym and I must say, love the ambiance. Friendly &
helpful staff. The bath towels are charged at $1 though but they do keep the
gym clean. They have a water dispenser instead of a water cooler, shower rooms
are well equipped with basic bathroom amenities, I think it is pretty neat. I
would totally recommend this gym.” – Krystal.J

are good with right posture and techniques first and then they will put in

“Always look forward to my training sessions every week, whether 1 on 1s with
Myren or the group classes with Thomas, Chris. Particularly like that they’re
so knowledgeable, explaining the nuances of each exercise, always watching out
for form, making sure you’re practicing safely, and pushing you in the right
direction. The programs Myren puts together are amazingly effective at helping
you reach your goals, whatever they may be. And seeing your own progress week
on week is darn addictive! First timers feeling intimidated trying out a new
thing, don’t be. You can’t find a more supportive community here, whether with
the incredible coaches or fellow members!” – Vanessa.S

years and it has been stupendous. They have kettlebells up to 48kg, safety
squat bar, rogue bars and Assault bike and Ski-Erg and everything else you
need for the general gym goer and hardcore lifter alike. Plus the Coaches
Myren and Elaine are caring and extremely versatile coaches.” – Ryan.C

solid foundation instead of ego lifting. Strength classes are a good start
point for anyone looking to lose weight or gain strength. Expect results only
if you’re willing to commit. Group classes have 6 pax max but the coach
usually focuses on those who are new, while still looking out for the more
experienced lifters.” – Shane.B

address my specific body concerns using the latest wearable technology so I
can see my real time stats. I also love the group glasses, kept to a small

**Review**

| “Great teachers, fun environment, and overall good atmosphere. We decided to
enroll our son in My Gym’s playgroup program when he was 19 months old because
we strongly feel that this is the best place to develop his cognitive, social,
physical and emotional skills. Also, being an active child, it’s a perfect
place for him to exert all the energy.

Being a former My Gym teacher (I had a blast being one!), I am familiar with
the programs and love how enthusiastic and involved My Gym teachers are. We
know our son thoroughly enjoys his time at his playgroup class. We could
already tell that his confidence is growing day by day. From the first week
when he was hesitant and slightly tentative, to the fourth week when he was
exploring all the various gym elements at will and now he is able to recognize
all his friends by their names!

My Gym is much more than a place to go and play. My child has developmentally
and socially improved tremendously, in more ways than one. We have made so
many friends and the staff truly feels like family. They genuinely love each
child and celebrate their individual successes. Keep up the good work guys! ♥

## **Important Tips for Choosing the Right Gym**

There are so many gym facilities in Singapore. While this presents you with
options, it makes it hard for you to single out that one gym that’s perfect
for you.

Luckily for you, here are a few pointers on how to choose the perfect gym for
you:

### **Location Matters**

Choose a gym that’s closer to you. Search around for a gym that’s within a
15-minute walk from where you live or work. Or one you can easily pass by when
heading home from work.

### **Cleanliness**

The hygienic condition of the place you workout matters a lot. You don’t have
to contend with other people’s sweat. It’s also a great idea to check out the
washroom and changing room and make sure everything is up to the required
hygienic standard.

### **Personnel**

It’s the same thing with any business. You have a better chance of succeeding
and realising your health goals by working with a friendly gym instructor and
customer support.

### **Equipment and Facilities**

Make sure the gym you choose has all the equipment and facilities you’ll need
to achieve your goals. If you plan to gain muscles and buff up, then make sure
the gym has free weights. The same applies to those interested in yoga classes
or doing cardio.

### **Access**

Make sure the gym’s work hours meshes with your schedule. The good thing is
that there are so many 24-hour gym franchises in the country.

### **Cost and Contract**

Before you sign up with any gym, be sure to go through their contract and make
sure there are no hidden charges. Will gyms also tend to have coupons and
discounts that you may want to take advantage of.

## **Gym Trends to Should Watch Out For in 2020**

The past few years have seen to it that new gym trends emerge and
revolutionise the entire industry. 2020 is here, and it’s not like it’s about
to make an exception. As the year rolls by, be sure to witness the following
trends:

### **Fitness Tracking Wearables**

Exercising is set to be a little more technologically advanced than it’s been
through the years. Active tracking wearables are finding their way mainstream,
thus becoming even more common.

### **Group Workouts**

Group training is becoming the order of the day. This is not exactly a new
trend, but there’s an upsurge in the number of people enjoying the social
aspect of exercising as a group.

### **Mental Health GYMs**

People are beginning to be more concerned about their mental health, and are
looking for ways to improve it. That explains why mental gyms (such as
hypnotherapy, sleep workshops, and counselling) are increasingly becoming
popular.

### **Family Workouts**

You’ve probably seen many parents exercising with their little ones. It’s a
trend that’s fast picking shape. In fact, many gyms are even offering children
friendly gym sessions, which allows parents to bring their little ones and
have them enjoy dance lessons or team sports as they exercise in a separate
room.

Sorry, [gym bros](https://www.augustman.com/sg/sg/wellness/fitness/global-gym-
memberships-perfect-jet-setting-gentleman/), but bicep curls do not equate to
weightlifting, no matter how heavy your dumbbells are. Before you come for us
with pitchforks and Molotovs in shaker bottles, hear us out — engaging in
[strength-building
exercises](https://www.augustman.com/sg/sg/wellness/fitness/7-workouts-you-
can-steal-from-the-fittest-guys-of-instagram/) (as the average person does in
the gym) is lifting weights in the semantic sense, but it’s a completely
different breed from the true sport of weightlifting. For that, it helps to
have proper weightlifting gyms at your disposal.

Weightlifting, more commonly referred to as Olympic or Oly lifting, involves
only two movements: the [clean and
jerk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HyWjAk7fhY), as well as the
[snatch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBc5N_-xdqo). These highly technical,
explosive lifts engage your entire body, offering a [comprehensive
workout](https://www.augustman.com/sg/sg/wellness/fitness/best-bouldering-
gyms-in-singapore/) that even the average person can benefit from, as long as
proper technique is in place.

A gamut of digital resources exist to help one get familiar with
weightlifting, be it YouTube how-tos or Reddit communities that welcome form
checks. Still, the best way to cut one’s teeth in the sport is to join a gym
that offers specialised classes run by experienced weightlifting coaches as
you’ll gain far more with hands-on guidance.

Olympic weightlifting may still be a niche in Singapore, but there are a
handful of dedicated gyms that let budding weightlifters get familiar with the
snatch, and clean and jerk. These typically feature proper equipment (read: no
hex plates, and actual lifting platforms), weightlifting groups known as
barbell clubs, and legitimate coaches that you can engage personal training
from if you’re willing to invest. Here are some of our picks.

01

The Strength Yard

![olympic weightlifting gyms in singapore](https://images.augustman.com/wp-
content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/07163748/am-placeholder-img.png?tr=q-60)

The Strength Yard is a strength and conditioning gym housed in a shophouse
along Joo Chiat. The gym itself houses nine lifting platforms open for public
use, along with a six-week-long beginner’s course that zones in on the 101s of
Olympic weightlifting. Each class runs for 90 minutes with only six
participants to a coach, perfect for novice to intermediate lifters looking to
progress their technique in a semi-intimate setting.

02

The Forge

![olympic weightlifting gyms in singapore](https://images.augustman.com/wp-
content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/07163748/am-placeholder-img.png?tr=q-60)

Lavender’s red-walled Olympic weightlifting facility is the place to be if you
want to be competent, or even proficient at the sport. Patrons pay a monthly
fee and get assigned to a coach who will guide them through a programme
catered to their level. Training typically runs thrice a week, making The
Forge a destination for lifters seriously looking to get better. If the
commitment seems hefty, just remember that one ever got good at anything just
by putting in the bare minimum.

03

Singapore Weightlifting Federation

![best weightlifting gyms in singapore](https://images.augustman.com/wp-
content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/07163748/am-placeholder-img.png?tr=q-60)

Learn at the hub of Singapore’s professional weightlifting circuit with the
Singapore Weightlifting Federation. They hold a quarterly schedule of
weightlifting workshops that will get registrants familiar with the basics,
lasting just two hours long. While it may not provide the same level of
guidance that other gyms do, this is a cost-effective place to get you
familiar with what Olympic Weightlifting is and whether it’s a sport you’d
like to pursue.

04

Solitude of Strength

![olympic weightlifting singapore](https://images.augustman.com/wp-
content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/07163748/am-placeholder-img.png?tr=q-60)

Solitude of Strength is run by national weightlifter, Lewis Chua, also known
as The Buffalo. This 5,166 square feet open-air gym holds a variety of
classes, including Max Lift, dedicated to perfecting Olympic weightlifting
movements, as well as guiding members to hitting PRs on their snatch, clean,
and jerk. Personal training is also offered with their weightlifting coaches,
most of whom also compete at a professional level.

CrossFit Mobilus offers a lot of encouragement, like no other gym I’ve been
to. Even when competing for the fastest time, the community tie is solid at
CrossFit Mobilus. And MobCon, a 30-minute metabolic conditioning class
intended to boost endurance, isn’t any different. The Workout of the Day
(WOD), often referred to as a benchmark, is announced and different
participants will race against the clock to complete the prescribed reps and
see who can finish first.

CrossFit Mobilus features a variety of workouts that appeal to both novice and
expert CrossFitters. On an Airdyne, for example, you might cycle or perform
barbell deadlifts with a partner. Don’t worry if you’re alone; the camaraderie
that develops from doing the WOD as part of a group is perhaps one of its
biggest draws.

#### Key Differentiators

  1. Range of exercises
  2. Community bond is strong

quick, short workouts, Ritual Gym is definitely worth considering. Ritual Gym
specializes in High Intensity Interval Training, which involves brief bursts
of intense activity followed by rest periods. Because sessions at the Ritual

minutes that they do spend at Ritual Gym will be time well spent because it is
likely to yield results and make them feel great.

Ritual Gym is accessible in two ways: a small group class in one of their
three (turning 4) branches, and an app. This means you may do your Ritual Gym
exercise at any time, even if you’re on the road.

### What are gyms?

Gyms are places where you can go to exercise and improve your physical
fitness. They provide a variety of equipment such as dumbells, weights and
machines such as cardiovascular machines that you can use to work out, as well
as the staff who can help you with your body workouts. Going to the gym for a
workout can help you improve your fitness levels and metabolic rate,
strengthen your core, build muscles and burn calories with cardio training.
There are many different gyms in Singapore, each with its own unique set of
features and benefits. Gyms also have dedicated personal trainers who design
programmes based on different levels. These experienced trainers will ensure
guidance through high intensity interval training to help you reach your
fitness goals.

### Should I get a gym membership?

The answer to this question really depends on your fitness goals and budget.
Gym membership fees can be expensive, but if you go regularly, the cost can be
worth it. However, there are also affordable gyms available. If you are
looking for a place to start getting fit, or want to improve your current
level of fitness, then a gym membership is the best option. Gyms offer a
variety of programmes and a fully equipped gym can cater to most fitness
levels and goals and can be effective for your fitness journey. However, if
you are not sure if you will stick with it, or do not have the budget for it,
then consider starting off with a trial membership or day pass to test out the
gym first before signing up. There are also monthly plans available and it is
essential to sign up for a gym membership or club that offers convenience as
it has multiple locations or is open 24/7. With a membership, you will have
full access to the full range of equipment available hence you should always
look out for membership plans that best suits you!

### What is personal training?

Personal training services are offered in many gyms, which provides one-on-one
training with certified personal trainers. This service is usually more
expensive than a regular gym membership as the trainers have different rates
but can provide great value if you are looking to achieve specific fitness
goals. A personal trainer will design a programme tailored specifically for
you and will help to motivate and guide you through your workouts. They can
also provide support outside of the gym by providing advice on the nutrition
you need, helping to keep you on track and would plan your meals. If you are
looking for extra guidance, want to achieve specific fitness goals or just
need someone to keep you accountable, then personal training may be the right
option for you! The good thing about personal training is that there are no
peak prices but some trainers also offer promotions, seasonal packages. deals
or vouchers and would be in the comfort of your lifestyle. However, if you are
on a tight budget, getting a gym membership would be more suitable for you to
have a sweat sesh, where you can even opt for small groups training or group
fitness classes

### What are the benefits of working out?

The benefits of working out are vast and can be summed up into three
categories: physical, mental and emotional. Physically, working out can help
to improve your overall health by reducing the risk of diseases such as heart
disease, stroke and cancer. It can also help to improve your stamina, increase
your lifespan, make you stronger and keep your body in shape! Mentally,
working out releases endorphins that make you feel good and happy. It can also
help to improve your mood, cognitive function and memory, allowing your mental
wellness to improve. Lastly, emotionally, working out can help to reduce
stress levels, anxiety and depression. It can also help to improve self-esteem
and body image, keeping your mental health healthy. When looking for a gym,
always ensure that it has a wide range of basic equipment such as treadmills
and strength equipment. The experience of working out can also bring joy and
freedom to some. Of course, to achieve your goals, it is vital to stay
committed hence finding highly qualified trainers that will bring out your
passion can be a good option for you.

### What kind of training is available?

There are many types of training that are available in gyms, but the most
popular ones are weightlifting, cardio and bodybuilding. Weightlifting helps
to increase muscle mass and strength and is a great way to burn calories. It
can also help to improve bone density and reduce the risk of injuries. Cardio
helps to improve heart health and aerobic fitness by increasing your heart
rate for an extended period of time. It is a great way to burn calories, lose
weight and increase fat loss. Lastly, bodybuilding helps to sculpt your
muscles and can be done with free weights or machines. You can also look out
for more in-depth training such as metabolic conditioning, conditioning
training programs and resistance training where you will have to engage with
resistance training equipment and resistance training machines. In addition,
it is also important to find a program that best suits you.

Weightlifting has become an increasingly popular way to work out in the last
few years – yup, [amongst women
too](https://www.issaonline.com/blog/index.cfm/2019/for-women-weight-lifting-
is-essential-heres-why). It’s one of the most efficient ways to build muscle
and increase your metabolic rate, and it’s also just really… fun. How else can
you do a [workout](https://citynomads.com/sweat-sesh-style-a-womans-guide-to-
choosing-the-right-workout-wear/) that’s 40% hard work and 60% resting and
chatting with your friends? Here are some of the best lifting gyms in
Singapore where you can get your [heart rate](https://citynomads.com/party-on-
a-bike-best-spin-studios-and-classes-in-singapore-to-get-your-blood-pumping/)
up, your muscles working hard and your sense of community absolutely thriving.

## Strength Avenue

![strength avenue trainers](https://citynomads.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/10/strength-avenue-trainers.jpg)

Started in 2016, Strength Avenue occupies the second floor of a Boat Quay
shophouse, overlooking the Singapore River. It’s a comforting view to have as
you grind through your sets of squats. Strength Avenue believes that all
people can benefit from being stronger, and their focus on form and technique
means that their training is safe for people of all shapes, sizes and ages.
Trainers plan based on your weaknesses in private coaching; if you prefer to
work out with friends, their semi-private classes include kettlebell training
and barbell training, and are small enough that you’ll receive personal
attention and assessment.

_[Strength Avenue](https://strengthavenue.com.sg/) is located at 57B Boat Quay
Singapore 049846. Open 7am – 9pm, based on class schedule and appointments.
Contact them [here](https://strengthavenue.com.sg/contact/)._

## The Strength Yard![](https://citynomads.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/10/strength-yard.jpg)

This Joo Chiat gym is perfect for East-siders wanting to get strong. The
Strength Yard is a strength training facility with monthly passes to their
gym, as well as personal training and progressive strength group classes. This
gym is well-known for its fully equipped space and for offering open access to
their space for most hours of the day. Take their classes to learn the basics,
then keep using their open gym at your own convenience!

_[The Strength Yard](https://www.thestrengthyard.com/) is located at 369 Joo
Chiat Road, Singapore 427614, p. +65 6909 7449. Open Mon-Sun 6am – 12am with
card access._

## The Forge![](https://citynomads.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-forge-
lifting-gym.jpg)

This private, personal training Olympic weightlifting and barbell club in
Little India believes that Olympic weightlifting should be accessible to
athletes of all levels. They focus on motions like the Snatch, Clean and Jerk,
but have strength and conditioning training as well. ​Training is extremely
personalised and sessions are coordinated between gym-goers and assigned
coaches. You’re recommended to schedule at least three training sessions a
week, each lasting one and a half hours. What better way is there to get
stronger than being held accountable for putting in good, regular practice?

_[The Forge](https://www.theforge.sg/) is located at 451 Race Course Road,
Singapore 218695. Open Mon, Wed, Fri 7am − 10pm, Tue & Thu 2pm – 10pm, Sat &
PH 10am – 1pm. Closed Sun._

## Level![](https://citynomads.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/level-gym-
interior.jpg)

This gym with both branches in the CBD has classes for anyone, at any level.
Try their high-intensity SWEAT class if you want to get your conditioning in,
or their STRUCTURE class if you want to learn the basics of using gym
equipment like barbells, dumbbells and kettlebells. Are you already fairly
fit? Then try SKILL, their flagship class led by current and former
competitive athletes. They have classes for bodyweight movements, handstands
and conditioning – anything you could want to train for. There are also
virtual classes and personal training.

_[Level](https://level.com.sg/) can be found at 137 Telok Ayer Street #01-03
Singapore 068602, p. +65 6222 4766, and 14 Robinson Road #01-00 Singapore
048545. p. +65 6787 9560. Open Mon-Fri 7am – 8pm, Sat-Sun 8am – 1pm._

## Solitude of Strength![](https://citynomads.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/10/solitude-of-strength-squat.jpg)

Solitude of Strength is easily the biggest functional gym on the island,
making it a no-brainer if space is a concern for you (social distancing,
anyone?). Located in Woodleigh Park just off Braddell Road, coaches here
believe that functional movements can help everybody age better. They offer a
whole range of classes for different levels – FuncFit caters to all levels of
fitness and all ages, while Strongman Classics introduces the techniques of
lifting large amounts of weight and flipping massive tires. Check out their
passes – they have different ones for classes, open gym usage and a
combination of the two. They even have student discounts!

_[Solitude of Strength](https://solitudeofstrength.com/) is located at 48
Woodleigh Park, Unit #6, The Arena, Singapore 357844, p. +65 8123 4362. Open
Mon – Sun, 6.30am – 11.30pm._

### Elevate Barbell Club

![](https://citynomads.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/elevate-barbell.jpg)

This gym is all about getting your basics down and increasing functionality
for people from all different backgrounds. Their basic strength course will
focus on the four most common movements in weight training: the squat, the
bench press, the deadlift, and the overhead press. They have personal training
as well, giving you a structured program and nutrition guidance. When you’re
advanced enough to train on your own, try out their online training where they
program your training for you – you just need to execute.

_Elevate Barbell Club is located at_ 482 Macpherson Road #01-01, Singapore
368194 _, p. +65 8818 9817. Open Mon – Fri 10am − 10pm, Sat – Sun 10am − 6pm._

CrossFit Mobilus offers a lot of encouragement, like no other gym I’ve been
to. Even when competing for the fastest time, the community tie is solid at
CrossFit Mobilus. And MobCon, a 30-minute metabolic conditioning class
intended to boost endurance, isn’t any different. The Workout of the Day
(WOD), often referred to as a benchmark, is announced and different
participants will race against the clock to complete the prescribed reps and
see who can finish first.

CrossFit Mobilus features a variety of workouts that appeal to both novice and
expert CrossFitters. On an Airdyne, for example, you might cycle or perform
barbell deadlifts with a partner. Don’t worry if you’re alone; the camaraderie
that develops from doing the WOD as part of a group is perhaps one of its
biggest draws.

#### Key Differentiators

  1. Range of exercises
  2. Community bond is strong

that’s the case, Pure Fitness’ gym membership is most likely for you. Though
their monthly expenses may be greater than typical, it is well-justified by
the sheer quantity of classes they offer, from TR-X training to yoga to Zumba

unlike any other gym I’ve seen in Toronto.

If you’re looking for a gym membership that will help you get the most out of
quick, short workouts, Ritual Gym is definitely worth considering. Ritual Gym
specializes in High Intensity Interval Training, which involves brief bursts
of intense activity followed by rest periods. Because sessions at the Ritual
Gym are only about 30 minutes long, this is ideal for people who want to be
more active, but don’t have a lot of free time. For most people, the 30
minutes that they do spend at Ritual Gym will be time well spent because it is
likely to yield results and make them feel great.

Ritual Gym is accessible in two ways: a small group class in one of their
three (turning 4) branches, and an app. This means you may do your Ritual Gym
exercise at any time, even if you’re on the road.

### What are gyms?

Gyms are places where you can go to exercise and improve your physical
fitness. They provide a variety of equipment such as dumbells, weights and
machines such as cardiovascular machines that you can use to work out, as well
as the staff who can help you with your body workouts. Going to the gym for a
workout can help you improve your fitness levels and metabolic rate,
strengthen your core, build muscles and burn calories with cardio training.
There are many different gyms in Singapore, each with its own unique set of
features and benefits. Gyms also have dedicated personal trainers who design
programmes based on different levels. These experienced trainers will ensure
guidance through high intensity interval training to help you reach your
fitness goals.

### Should I get a gym membership?

The answer to this question really depends on your fitness goals and budget.
Gym membership fees can be expensive, but if you go regularly, the cost can be
worth it. However, there are also affordable gyms available. If you are
looking for a place to start getting fit, or want to improve your current
level of fitness, then a gym membership is the best option. Gyms offer a
variety of programmes and a fully equipped gym can cater to most fitness
levels and goals and can be effective for your fitness journey. However, if
you are not sure if you will stick with it, or do not have the budget for it,
then consider starting off with a trial membership or day pass to test out the
gym first before signing up. There are also monthly plans available and it is
essential to sign up for a gym membership or club that offers convenience as
it has multiple locations or is open 24/7. With a membership, you will have
full access to the full range of equipment available hence you should always
look out for membership plans that best suits you!

### What is personal training?

Personal training services are offered in many gyms, which provides one-on-one
training with certified personal trainers. This service is usually more
expensive than a regular gym membership as the trainers have different rates
but can provide great value if you are looking to achieve specific fitness
goals. A personal trainer will design a programme tailored specifically for
you and will help to motivate and guide you through your workouts. They can
also provide support outside of the gym by providing advice on the nutrition
you need, helping to keep you on track and would plan your meals. If you are
looking for extra guidance, want to achieve specific fitness goals or just
need someone to keep you accountable, then personal training may be the right
option for you! The good thing about personal training is that there are no
peak prices but some trainers also offer promotions, seasonal packages. deals
or vouchers and would be in the comfort of your lifestyle. However, if you are
on a tight budget, getting a gym membership would be more suitable for you to
have a sweat sesh, where you can even opt for small groups training or group
fitness classes

### What are the benefits of working out?

The benefits of working out are vast and can be summed up into three
categories: physical, mental and emotional. Physically, working out can help
to improve your overall health by reducing the risk of diseases such as heart
disease, stroke and cancer. It can also help to improve your stamina, increase
your lifespan, make you stronger and keep your body in shape! Mentally,
working out releases endorphins that make you feel good and happy. It can also
help to improve your mood, cognitive function and memory, allowing your mental
wellness to improve. Lastly, emotionally, working out can help to reduce
stress levels, anxiety and depression. It can also help to improve self-esteem
and body image, keeping your mental health healthy. When looking for a gym,
always ensure that it has a wide range of basic equipment such as treadmills
and strength equipment. The experience of working out can also bring joy and
freedom to some. Of course, to achieve your goals, it is vital to stay
committed hence finding highly qualified trainers that will bring out your
passion can be a good option for you.

### What kind of training is available?

There are many types of training that are available in gyms, but the most
popular ones are weightlifting, cardio and bodybuilding. Weightlifting helps
to increase muscle mass and strength and is a great way to burn calories. It
can also help to improve bone density and reduce the risk of injuries. Cardio
helps to improve heart health and aerobic fitness by increasing your heart
rate for an extended period of time. It is a great way to burn calories, lose
weight and increase fat loss. Lastly, bodybuilding helps to sculpt your
muscles and can be done with free weights or machines. You can also look out
for more in-depth training such as metabolic conditioning, conditioning
training programs and resistance training where you will have to engage with
resistance training equipment and resistance training machines. In addition,
it is also important to find a program that best suits you.

## Hear from our community

"I have been taking regular private movement classes and intermittent CST
sessions with Kathy for a year now and it has been a joy and a privilege. It
is not easy to take on a 60 year old who has scoliosis and who does not always
feel the correct alignment of a normal body as it moves and very often I come
to class with chronic jaw pain, a sluggish body and emotions to match. Kathy
innately understands individual bodies and designs her class to cater to
uniquely build muscle in spite of the imbalance and strengthens different
parts of the body. She takes the trouble to video each exercise on the phone
so that one can build daily individual sequences with each session that I can
practise at home and not get bored. Kathy is extremely professional, talented,
has amazing knowledge of anatomy of the body and how it works but most
importantly, she has the ability to encourage, motivate, be patient, empathise
and heal as the need arises. All these qualities make her an exceptional
pilates and movement teacher with compassion and a big heart. I am indeed
fortunate to know her. I have made progress and I recommend her unreservedly."

Angeline G

"I recently participated in the Contrast Therapy Workshop at Soma Haus. The
instructor, Chun, was fantastic and gave me a better understanding of the
practical benefits of breathing techniques combined with cold water exposure."

Daniel A

"Denise is an excellent manual therapist. She understands the body and is able
to quickly identify the areas that I needed most help with. I received a
myofascial massage and didn't realise in the process I also learned a lot
about my own body. Denise also recommended some stretches that helped to
improve my overall mobility. I am so grateful."

George R

"Kathy is a magician when it comes to identifying and treating physical pain.
Her ability to direct the energy to areas of concern just by light touch is
nothing short of amazing. While her main focus is alleviating physical pain,
she often also finds how this pain may be related to emotional issues. She is
a caring and very capable therapist. I have seen her for 4 years and I have a
better life for it. I strongly recommend her if you suffer from pain or
fatigue."

Jacinta Y

"My body was feeling so stiff and I really needed the additional release. As
sera (Acupressure Masseuse) worked on my body, there were sensations that I
simply couldn’t find the words for. She released tensions that I didn’t even
know existed. I think I went to heaven a couple of times. I left feeling so
relaxed as if I have just been rebirth.."

Jessica L

"Ms. Gabriel has administered cranialsacral therapy to me for the last 6
months to improve my insomnia and gastro intestinal problems and I have
observed a marked improvement in both areas since we began the treatment . I
recommend her work unreservedly to all patients in need of such help."

Johan B

"I received both Structural bodywork and Craniosacral Therapy with Kathy.
Struggling with chronic back pain (from injury) and jaw tension I was unsure
what to expect during my first session. She was genuine in walking me through
everything and creating the safe space for me to trust and release into the
healing space of the work. I was surprised to feel a difference in my body
after only 3 sessions but felt motivated to explore more. I learned so much
about my body in my sessions and now much better in managing my pain in my
body. Deeply grateful and would like to say that if you feel the slightest bit
curious about this practice then give it a shot - your body will thank you!"

Stephanie L

"Loved the experience and the little things you guys put in place to make sure
I felt comfortable. Receptionist / front line manager was lovely, tea was nice
and giving me time to just chill after my sweat was amazing. The sweat was
awesome.. and reasonably priced too. I feel a lot better after it. I've signed
up for 10 sessions more!"

## Our services

Our suite of non-invasive technology helps to create the most optimal
environment for your body to heal. We believe that there are no shortcuts to
health. Without consistent maintenance and support, the body cannot do what
its best at doing - compensate, repair and regulate. From saunas, ice baths to
flotation devices, you can use them alone or as powerful combination for
recovery and regulation.

#####  [Geoff Fazan](https://www.thestrengthyard.com/geoff-fazan/)

I didn't know quite what to expect when I first came to The Strength Yard, as
it is hard to judge a book by the cover. Terence explained The Strength Yard
purpose well and the sort of strength training we would be doing and why.
After a couple of sessions getting to know one another, going to The Strength
Yard felt very natural.... **Read More**

#####  [Scott](https://www.thestrengthyard.com/scott/)

I came to The Strength Yard looking to be taught the correct way to lift
weights in order to avoid injury. I met Ian, who taught to me the proper form
and technique to lifting weights. I have made progression through learning the
movements at a pace I was comfortable with.... **Read More**

#####  [Max Koh](https://www.thestrengthyard.com/max-koh/)

I joined because i just turned 30 and have been lifting on my own consistently
for the last 8 years. Felt that my workouts were getting stale, and i also
wanted someone to ensure I was lifting with proper form, for fear of injuries
as I am no longer in my 20s.... **Read More**

#####  [Elisabeth Kelly](https://www.thestrengthyard.com/elisabeth-kelly/)

Before I started Strength Training at The Strength Yard, I would wonder, would
a young male trainer understand the needs, health issues (hormonal) and goals
of a woman almost twice his age? However Terence is a patient and
understanding trainer.... **Read More**

#####  [Ryan Aidan](https://www.thestrengthyard.com/ryan-aidan/)

I feel relaxed and not super pressurizing when Terence was coaching me.
Initially I had the impression that going to the gym or doing weightlifting
was going be super intense or difficult but turns out that wasn't the case....

#####  [EVA LEUNG](https://www.thestrengthyard.com/eva-leung/)

I’ve tried weight watchers, noom, vegan, whole30, and a smattering of other
diets, so I was a bit skeptical if it was another diet where I have to starve
myself and eat yucky food. I also really didn’t want to bulk up and look like
a female version of Arnold Swazenager.... **Read More**

#####  [Matthew Yeo](https://www.thestrengthyard.com/matthew-yeo/)

As a runner, I have always been trying to strengthen my gluteus to improve my
running and to prevent injury. Using 3kg of dumbbell to do squat has proven
not as effective. I randomly ran into The Strength Yard, spoke to Terence and
arranged a trial session with him.... **Read More**

At first, I had reservations about signing up because I wasn't sure if it's
going to work or not (whether I will be losing weight or just losing money). I
was also apprehensive that I'll be stuck with a haughty, macho Johnny-Bravo
type of trainer. However, Terence is very professional, accommodating and
humble.... **Read More**

## Strength Training And Aging

Leading a sedentary lifestyle leads to muscle atrophy. It is the medical term
that describes the process of your muscles wasting away. When your muscles
aren’t exercised to their full capacity, they begin to break down.

When your body begins to lose muscle, your metabolism slows and you begin to
gain weight. Increased body fat eats away at testosterone, and it can be a
vicious cycle. Low testosterone causes depression, lethargy, and fatigue that
can keep you from exercising to lose fat and build muscle.

## The Job Of A Personal Trainer

Many often wonder if the cost of having a Personal Trainer is worth it.

The short answer is perhaps. If you have the intrinsic motivation, you can
join a gym and plan your own program independently by referring to the
numerous resources available online, not a problem at all.

## Strength Training And Your Immunity

Upper respiratory tract infections (The common cold, sinusitis etc.) are the
most common illness that people get. Most are due to an infection with a virus
and the average adult has two to four URTIs each year.

We are constantly exposed to the viruses that cause these infections but some
people seem more susceptible to catching URTIs than others and our immune
system plays an important part that protect us from an army of pathogenic
microbes that bombard the body.

## Setting Your New Year’s Fitness Resolution

After a holiday season of being merry, many of us start setting fitness
resolutions for the New year only to see them fall by the wayside.

It Is a pretty depressing statistic. In fact, survey shows that only 20% of
people actually achieve their goals and more than 70% of people give up within
the first 2 months.

## Introduction To Olympic Weightlifting

weightlifting’ is one of the oldest forms of weight training. The moves are
incredibly technical and they take require considerable strength to complete.

## When You Hit A Plateau In Training And How To Deal With It

We know you take your training seriously. From our serious competitive
athletes to our casual class members you are always looking to be the
strongest version of yourselves.

There is only so much we can progressively overload till we hit a wall in
training. Some lucky ones have a higher threshold than others but we’ll all
eventually find our progress starting to get slower or for even some, remain
stagnant for a period of time.

## Stay Fit While Traveling

Hey everybody, holiday season is upon us and in fact, we have just treated
ourselves to a weekend road trip to Malaysia, tasting the local cuisine and
sampling every type of street food.

While I know many of you will start stressing out over how to remain fit while
on the road, understand that your hard work will not be gone to waste.

#####  [Geoff Fazan](https://www.thestrengthyard.com/geoff-fazan/)

I didn't know quite what to expect when I first came to The Strength Yard, as
it is hard to judge a book by the cover. Terence explained The Strength Yard
purpose well and the sort of strength training we would be doing and why.
After a couple of sessions getting to know one another, going to The Strength
Yard felt very natural.... **Read More**

I came to The Strength Yard looking to be taught the correct way to lift

I joined because i just turned 30 and have been lifting on my own consistently

wanted someone to ensure I was lifting with proper form, for fear of injuries
as I am no longer in my 20s.... **Read More**

Before I started Strength Training at The Strength Yard, I would wonder, would
a young male trainer understand the needs, health issues (hormonal) and goals

I’ve tried weight watchers, noom, vegan, whole30, and a smattering of other

As a runner, I have always been trying to strengthen my gluteus to improve my

At first, I had reservations about signing up because I wasn't sure if it's
going to work or not (whether I will be losing weight or just losing money). I

type of trainer. However, Terence is very professional, accommodating and

## TESTIMONIAL

> **ZANE**

“The massage was up to my expectations, it addressed my tightness in various
muscles and after the session I felt better with less knee pain as well.”
[@zane_ljh](https://www.instagram.com/zane_ljh/)

When a muscle is tight it can irritate nerve receptors within the muscle. This
in turn can lead to feelings of muscular pain and discomfort.  
As for Zane’s case, he has been feeling some discomfort around the patella
area which could be due to the increased training volume from squatting.
Therefore, reducing muscular tension can lead to a reduction in nerve
irritation and a reduction in muscular pain and discomfort.
